If you use a port bigger than 1024 with root privilege, but still got this problem, that's may be caused by SELinux:

Check this port, say 3002, in segange port

sudo semanage port -l | grep http_port_t

If 3002 doesn't exist in the port list, add it into segange port

sudo semanage port -a -t http_port_t  -p tcp 3002
